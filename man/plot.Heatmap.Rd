\title{Plot Heatmaps of Dissimilarity Matrices from scTypeEval Object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{Heatmap}(scTypeEval, dissimilarity.slot = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{scTypeEval}{An \code{scTypeEval} object containing one or more dissimilarity assays.}

\item{dissimilarity.slot}{Character string specifying which dissimilarity assay(s)
to use. If \code{"all"}, all available dissimilarity assays are plotted (default: \code{"all"}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{pheatmap::pheatmap()} for customizing
the heatmap appearance (e.g., \code{color}, \code{fontsize}, \code{legend}).}
}
\value{
A named list of heatmap objects generated by \pkg{pheatmap}, one per dissimilarity assay.
If only a single assay is selected, the corresponding heatmap object is returned.
}
\description{
This function visualizes dissimilarity matrices stored in an \code{scTypeEval} object
as annotated heatmaps using the \pkg{pheatmap} package. Each selected
dissimilarity assay is plotted as a heatmap with rows and columns ordered by
cell-type identity, and gaps added between groups.
}
\details{
For each dissimilarity assay:
\enumerate{
\item The dissimilarity matrix is extracted and reordered according to cell-type identity.
\item Annotation data frames are constructed for rows and columns, including
cell-type identity and sample information.
\item Group boundaries are marked with gaps to visually separate cell types.
\item A heatmap is drawn using \code{pheatmap::pheatmap()}.
}
The resulting plots provide a clear overview of dissimilarities between cell types
or samples, with optional customization via additional arguments.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Plot heatmaps for all dissimilarity assays
hm_all <- plot.Heatmap(sceval)
