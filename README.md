# scTypeEval
scTypeEval is an R package designed for the assessment and validation of cell type classifications in single-cell transcriptomics. In the absence of ground truth annotations, scTypeEval leverages internal validation metrics to evaluate the consistency and quality of cell type assignments, particularly across multiple biological samples.
